This project demonstrates the use of 4 micro servo motors connected to an Arduino Uno.Each servo motor is connected to a PWM digital pin and is programmed to rotate to different angles using the Servo library.

üîß Components Used:

Arduino Uno R3

4x Micro Servo Motors

Jumper Wires

Power from USB or external 5V (if needed)

‚ö°Ô∏è Pin Configuration:

Servo

Signal Pin

1

D3

2

D5

3

D6

4

D9

All servos share the same 5V and GND pins.

üíª Code Functionality:

The code rotates each servo motor to 0¬∞, then 90¬∞, then 180¬∞, with short delays between movements to avoid overload.
